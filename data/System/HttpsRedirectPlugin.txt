---++ Usage

The HTTPS redirect plug-in is designed to help you run a web site where guest users can access pages through HTTP and authenticated users will be forced to use HTTPS.
Simply activate the plug-in from =configure= to take advantage of its functionality.
Once enabled it will force authenticated users to use HTTPS by redirecting them to HTTPS URL if needed. Guests will be redirected to HTTPS only when accessing the login screen.
